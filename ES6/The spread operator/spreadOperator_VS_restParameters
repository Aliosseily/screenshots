Rest Parameters : allow us to pass an arbitrary number of arguments into a function . and use these arguments in this function .

Rest Parameters are opposite to spread operator .

Spread Operator take an array and transform it into a single values.

Rest Parameters receive a couple of single values and transform them into an array when we call a function with multiple parameters


The big differencs between Rest Parameters and Spread Operator is the place we use each of them . the spread operator is used in the function call , 

while the rest parameters is used in the function decoration to accept arbitrary number of parameters
